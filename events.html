      <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and<br> 
        know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the<br> 
        early navigators who used the stars to travel by. </p>
   

  
        <h3>Visiting Professor of Aeronautics</h3>
        <p>
            It is our pleasure to announce that Prof Sheila Widnall from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will be delivering 3 lectures<br> 
on the development of aeronautics and where the future lies in this exciting ‘space’.
        </p>



<h3>Night in the museum</h3>
<p>
    Get your family together for an exciting night in the museum as you sleep over beside dinosaurs and science displays.<br> 
Bring your own sleeping bag and get ready to rough it as we go exploring the wonders of science.
</p>



<h3>Energetica Exhibition on Loan</h3>
<p>On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum.<br> 
    It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the elements as we harness them. From solar energy<br> 
    powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control wind to create power.</p>
