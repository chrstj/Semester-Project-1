        <h2>Cosmology</h2>
        <p>
            Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and <br>
know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the<br>
early navigators who used the stars to travel by. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in<br> 
our solar system.
        </p>
  
    

        <h2>Evolution</h2>
        <p>
            For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get<br> 
here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.<br> 
        </p>

        <p>
            Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to<br>  
meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too. 
        </p>


    <h2>Biology and Medicine</h2>
        <p>
            From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of<br>  
the tiny world. 
        </p>

        <p>
            For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding<br> 
 of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the <br> 
discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant. 
        </p>
    

    <h2>Robotics</h2>
        <p>
            The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the science of the future. From useful home <br> 
applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.

    <h2>Ecology</h2>
        <p>
            As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it becomes that scientists<br>  
explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet
        </p>

    <p>
        In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming, extinction of <br> 
species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.
