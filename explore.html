        <h2>For Kids</h2>
        <p>
            Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do.<br> 
        </p>
        <p>
        You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in time and meet our resident <br> 
Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you come ready to learn<br> 
 and explore.
        </p>

            We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to<br> 
            explore and experiment with our team of experts.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can join other children your age to go on a journey of<br>  
discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about the holiday club and how you can join, 
send us a message.
