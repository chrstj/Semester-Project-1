        <h2>Support</h2>
        <p>
            There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are very welcome and are an <br>
important way we keep this museum open and accessible to the whole community. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also support us by donating items of interest to the museum’s collections. If you have some<br>
item or collection that you think others would enjoy, please let us know by contacting our Collections<br>
Department and they will be able to assist you.
        </p>
  
<h2>Volunteer</h2>
<p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and ready for visitors<br>
    to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of a working museum,<br>
     access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas<br>
    for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.</p>
   
<h2>Internships</h2>
<p>
    Are you interested in working in a museum? Do you enjoy the fun and excitement of sharing the wonders of<br> 
nature with people? Well you could be just the right person to enjoy an internship at the museum.
</p>
<p>
    You’ll be learning from a number of different academics and people who are passionate about science and<br> 
sharing it with the wider community.
