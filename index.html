        <h2>"Explore Together"</h3>
        <p>Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed to making science accessible to all.</p>
        <p>Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth<br>
             to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.</p>
        <p>The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our discoveries and<br> 
            perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.
            </p>
        <p>We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have<br> 
            over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for<br>
            you to interact with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to<br>
            life at night when everyone’s gone home).</p>
